// Updates v0.5
// - splits have been finished, there is one split towards the end that I'm not entirely certain
// -- where it triggers, but as long as the isGameLoaded variable works on other devices, this
// --- autosplitter is done
// - now onto the testing phase, good luck, speedrunners!

// Updates v0.4.1
// - isGameLoaded was tested and did not initially transfer over to my second computer
// -- However, I have already found a replacement value that also transfers over

// Updates v0.4
// - Splits have been added as well as a variable to determine if the game is loaded in or not
// - isGamePaused may not be an entirely stable variable either, further testing is required

// Updates v0.3.2
// - Found an isGameReady variable that seems to transfer from device to device, will send to Seth to test with his device

// Updates v0.3.1
// - isGameReady has been adjusted to a slightly more accessible value (this is hopefully a temporary fix until a consistent variable is found)
// - Timer will now only pause if the player pauses the game

// Updates v0.3
// - isGameReady has been fixed (hopefully)
// - isGamePaused has been added (this will replace the use of the inGameTimer to determine when the player has paused the game




// Current Issues:
// splits: currently testing to find a better "checkpoint" system for the autosplitter, as the current one has splits as short as a minute, and as
//    long as at least 30 minutes
// isGameReady will always be a pain in the butt
// isGamePaused may or may not be functional for all devices
